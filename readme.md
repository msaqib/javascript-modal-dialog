## A modal Yes / No dialog client-side library in JavaScript
This is a light weight modal dialog library written in vanilla JS. It is for times when you want to use a modal dialog on the client-side without using Node.js or any such complications.

### How to use 
Just copy and paste the style.css and modal.js files into your project directory, import the CSS file into your HTML file using the <link> tag, and the modal.js file into your HTML file using the <script> tag. Make sure that the <script> tag for the modal.js file appears before your own application's Javascript.
